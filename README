OVERVIEW
========

The project contains two modules:
    - OpenMXPlayer - the library, the "decoder"
    - OpenMXPlayerDemo - a simple project that illustrates how to use the player library, the "player"

The "decoder" module contains the Java code used for wrapping
the underlying  decoding algorithms (which is currently based on MediaCodec but it could be easily changed).

The "player" module is an example how to use the "decoder" library in your
project.
